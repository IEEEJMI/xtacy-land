This is the temporary landing page for IEEE JMI's techno-cultural festival, Xtacy.

Positive changes are welcome but we arent looking to develop this landing page too much. Those who are competent and interested in developing with us should email zrthxn@gmail.com

Others interested in participating or organizing can contact hello@xtacy.org
